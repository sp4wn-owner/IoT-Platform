This platform allows for rapid deployment and control of ESP32 microcontrollers. Run server.js locally (I'm using a Raspberry Pi). Copy ESP32_Web_Client code into your Arduino IDE and update the Wifi settings, server address, device name, and room number. You may need to update your USB driver. Then flash the code onto your ESP32 and it should automatically connect. You may run the web app on any local device or host it on your RPI apache web server. Open a port on your router to access it outside of your LAN OR deploy the server outside your LAN and connect your devices to it.
